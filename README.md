# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project showcases my work, skills, and experience as a software developer, with a focus on cloud computing, backend development, and data-driven solutions.

## Features

- **Home Page**: Introduction to who I am and what I do.
- **Projects**: A showcase of my personal and professional projects.
- **About Me**: Information about my background, skills, and experiences.
- **Contact**: A way to reach out to me through email and LinkedIn.
  
## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure and layout of the site.
- **CSS3**: For styling and responsive design (via master.css).
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and dynamic elements (via main.js).
- **Git**: Version control for managing project changes.
- **GitHub**: For hosting the repository and pushing changes.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your local machine.
2. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for code editing (optional but recommended).
3. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hemanth216-b/portfolio-website.git
   ```

### Running the Project Locally

1. After cloning the repository, open the `portfolio-website` folder in your preferred code editor (e.g., VS Code).
2. You can open the `home.html` file directly in your web browser or set up a local server using the following:

   If you have **VS Code**:
   - Install the **Live Server** extension (search for "Live Server" in the extensions panel).
   - Right-click on `home.html` and select **Open with Live Server**.
   
   This will launch the portfolio website locally in your browser.

## Usage

1. The website is designed to be responsive, meaning it will adjust its layout to fit various screen sizes, including mobile and tablet devices.
2. The **Projects** section links to GitHub repositories for each project. You can view the source code and explore the projects further.
3. The **Contact** section provides links to my email and LinkedIn for reaching out directly.
